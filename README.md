The *Decentralized Gaming Tournament Platform* is a blockchain-based solution that allows users to create, join, and manage gaming tournaments in a trustless and transparent way. Powered by Ethereum smart contracts, this platform eliminates the need for intermediaries, reduces the risk of fraud, and ensures that tournament rules and prize distributions are executed automatically and fairly.
